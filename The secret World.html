    The Secret World allows the player to control a character or avatar within a game world in third-or first-person view. This character can be used for exploration, fighting monsters, completing mission and intracting with players and non-players characters (NPCs).
    <br><br>
    The game starts with the player choosing the default "dimensions" while playing solo. This also decides which battlegroup the player is placed in within player versus player battlegrounds. The game make use of a single server technology that allows player to meet up people from any of the different servers, both in regular gameplay as well as instances and dungeons.  
</p>
<h3>
    COMBAT AND ABILITIES
</h3>
<p>
    The Secret World offers players a choice between tab-targeted combat or a more action-based combat where the targeted is selected with a crosshair in the middle of the screen. Abilities can be activated by pressing a certain hotkey and most abilities can also be activated while the character is moving. The player can choose from 9 different weapons types, divided in three categories; melee, magic and ranged. Melee weapons include blades, hammers and fist weaponss. Magic weapons include: blood magic, choase magic and elementalism. Ranged weapons include: Shotgunes, pistols and assault rifles. Note: After the game relaunched, the players may only choose froma a few predefined classes.
    <br><br>
    The player can wield teo of these weapons simultaneously and is also allowed 7 active and 7 passive abillties at at a time. Active abilities are further divided between builders and consumers. builders build resources either on target or the player, which are consumed by a consumer ability. The amount of resource consumed than decides the amount of damage that the consumer ability does.
    <br><br>
    The game has total 525 abilities which are stored in an "ability wheel" that allows the character to change their class and weapons types, as well as costomize their character's roles, at any point in time. This differs from traditional MMOs that lock a player to a class at a initial character creation phase. Their is also an auxiliary wheel which includes a different types of weapons, reffered to as auxiliary weapons.
</p>
<h3>
    MISSIONS
</h3>
<p>
    The missions come in several varieties. The main plot follows a faction-driven quest storyline. Character can also take on a main mission, faction-limited side quest, and three open side quests. Some mission involve fetching items or fighting monsters; others include a variety of puzzules that are quasi-alternate reality games that require "searching the internet" for clues with an game browser. Investigation missions have players have find facts and solve problems, and differ from the hack-and-slash mission. Sabotage require the player to nevigate areas, preferably without being spotted by enemies or automated traps.
    <br><br>
    The Secret World also supports groupings of characters called "cables", each made up of members of single faction, although many players have opted to develop thier own off-game grouping to unit character from different fractions.
</p>
<h3>
    PLAYER VS PLAYER
</h3>
<P>
    The Secret Worls has four main modes of player vs player (PvP) contant; The Fusang projects, a perpetual PvP zone based on capturing and holding "facilities" against the other two faction, El Dorado, a timed "capture the flag" style match with four "relics" that must be controlled to gain points for the team, staonehenge, a timed "king of the hill" style three faction match with 5 players per team, and shambala, a two team faction independent "team deathmatch" type of match. The Secret World PvP awarded "White Marks of vience" which could be exchanged for "Black Marks of vience" at an excange rate of 100 to 1. Currently, however, the game has eliminated PvP specific currency, and PvP minigames now issui black bullion and marks of the pantheon just the same as dungeons and missions. The only exception for this is the shambala minigame, which also awards special PvP specific signets that can be bound to gear.

Oregnally these issues were supposed to be realesed monthly, but when the game went from play-to-play to a buy-to-buy policy, this changed. The first four issues were incorporated in the based game while issue #5, "The vanishing of Tyler Freeborn", was provided free to change only to players have to perchased the game period to January 2013. Subsequent updates have been offered at a slower pace, usually taking sevral months for few new issues realesed. They are available as the paid for DLC for players. Funcom does not provide these issues free to subscribers and liftime users, instead including 1200 bonus points as part of its subscription and thus offring the option of only buying the DCLs users instrested in. After some concern by the subscribers and liftime members, Funcome started that the subscribers/liftime members would never have to pay more than 1200 bonus points for new issues. As of December 2016, a total of 15 issues have been released.
