</h1>
<p>
    Fortnite is distributed on three different modes:
    <br><br>
    ● <b>Fortnite: Save The World</b> is a player-versus-enviroment cooperative game, with four players callaborating towards a common objects on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across the Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and survivors to be attacked by
    <br>
    zombie-like "husks". The player take the role of commandors of home bassed shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment
    <br>
    that helps to either collect data on storm or to push back the storm. Frm missions, players are awarded a number of in-games items, which include
    <br>
    hero characters, weapons and trap schematics, and survivals, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.
    <br><br><br>
    ● <b>Fortnite Battle Royal</b> is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in duo, or in squade (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a "Battle Bus" that crosses the game map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate the players. Over the curse of round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incomming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quick evaluate. This forces remaining players into tighter space and encourages players encounter. The last player, duo or squade in winner.
    <br><br>
    ● <b>Fortnite Creative</b> Fortnite Creative is a sandbox game mode, similar to Mincraft in that player are given complete freedom to spawn evrything that is within the game on an island, and can creat games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more.
    <br><br>
    Players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structure on map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to built fortification, such as walles, floors and stairs. Such as fortification pieces can be edited to add things like Windows or doors. The matterial used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more material of the same type. Within Save The World this enables players to creat defensive fortification around an object or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In Battle Royal, this provide the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe. Players are encourged to be very intentive in designing their fortification in Creative.
