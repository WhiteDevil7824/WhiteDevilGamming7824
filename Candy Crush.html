    In the game, players complete levels by swapping colored pieces of candy on a game board to make match of three or more
    <br>
    of same colour, eleminating those candy from the board and replacing them with new one, which could potentaily creat
    <br>
    further matches. Matches of four or more candies creat unique candies taht act as a power-ups with large board-clearing
    <br>
    abilities. Boards have verious goals that must be completed within in a fixed number of move or limmited ammount of
    <br>
    time, such as certain score or collecting a specific number of a type of candy.
    <br><br>
    Candy Cursh Saga is considered one of the first and most successful uses of a freemium model; while the game can be
    <br>
    played completely through without spending money, players can by special actions to help clear more difficult boards,
    <br>
    from which King make its revenues-at its peak the company was reportedly earning almost $1 million per day. Around
    <br>
    2014, over 93 million people were playing Candy Crush Saga, while revenue over a three-months period as reported by
    <br>
    King was over $493 million. Five year after its release on mobile, the Candy Cursh Saga series has recieved over 2.7
    <br>
    billions downloads, and the game has been one of the hieghest-grossing and most-played mobile apps in that time frame.
    <br><br>
    King has since released three related titles, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Candy Cursh Jelly Saga and Candy Crush Friends 
    <br>
    Saga and most of the company's other mobile titles follow the same Sga freemuim format.

<h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 20;">
    Candy Crush Saga is a "match three" game, where the core gameplay is
    <br>
    based on swapping two adjecent candies among several on the gameboard
    <br>
    as to make a row or column at least three matching -colored candies. On
    <br>
    this match, the matched candies are removed from the board, and candies
    <br>
    above them fall into the empty spaces, with new candies appearing form
    <br>
    the top of the board. This may creat a new matched set of candies, which
    <br>
    is automatically cleared in the same manner. The player scores points for
    <br>
    these matches and gains progressively more pionts for chain reaction.
    <br>
    Additionally, creating matches of four or more candies will creat special
    <br>
    candy that, when matched, can clear row, column, or other section of the 
    <br>
    board.
    <br><br>
    The game is split among many levels, which must be completed in sequence. Each level poses a different challenge to the user, such as achieving a
    <br>
    minimum score in a fixed number of moves or clearing candies in fixed number of moves to bring special ingredients to the bottom of the board.
    <br>
    Board have a number of different configurations and may include special spaces taht have thier own unique rules, such as space covered with jelly
    <br>
    that must be cleared by making a match on that space. If the player meets the level's goal, they will be given from one to three stars based on their
    <br>
    score and can proceed into the next level. Otherwise, they will lose one life and must try again. If the player run out of lives, they have to wait for
    <br>
    some period of real-world time while their lives regenerate before attempting the level again.Completed levels can be replayed if desired.
</p>
<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20;">
    The game is primarily monetized through in-app Purchases (through either a credit card, Itunes crdits or Google Play credits); Players begin with
    <br>
    five "lives", lost whenever a level is failed. This applies all of King's games. When they are exausted, users can either send requests to their facebook
    <br>
    friends for more lives, wait for them to replenish themselves (a life is restored evry half-hour), or Purchase them. Initially when a player makes
    <br>
    for a new lives, they receive five new lives for a specific dollar ammount. In a recent update, when a player makes a purchase for a new lives, the
    <br>
    player receives gold bars, the quantity depending on how much money they spend. Gold bars can be used for new lives, extra moves, boosters or
    <br>
    to unlock a new episode. At certain points, primarily at the start of nwe "episodes", users must also either purchase or receive a request from at
    <br>
    least three friends before they may access the next set of level. An update meant players waited for only three days to unlock the next level.
    <br><br>
    Booster, to make the level easier, can be bought using in-app purchases. While the game includes freemium content, 97.7% of those playing
    <br>
    the game do so for free, while only 2.3% pay.  
</p>
<h2>Character</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20;">
    Throughout the game, the player solves puzzles so Tiffi (Short for Toffette) can solve problems plaguing the residents of the candy Kingdom.
    <br>
    These include tutorial guide Mr. Toffee, whose voice was changed from an over-the-top French accent in the orignal version of the game into
    <br>
    a more modest deep male voice; the Easter Bunny; the shop owner Mr. Yeti; Odus the owl from dreamworld levels; the villainous Bubblegum
    <br>
    Troll; and many others.
    <br><br>
    In Candy Crush Jelly Saga, the two main Characters that the player plays against are the Jelly Queen and Cupcake Carl.
</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20;">
    Prior to the release of Candy Crush Saga, most of king's games were browser games offered through their website or the partner portals such
    <br>
    as Yahoo!. This include Candy Crush, a straightforward tile-matching game released in 2011 which King's cheif creative officer and co-founder
    <br>
    Sebastain Knutsson said come after few hundred of other games thae had designed for the portal. Candy Crush's cancept had been based on an
    <br>
    early game King made, Miner Speed, that borrowed gameplay elements from Bejeweled. Candy Crush added new animations for the candies,
    <br>
    and expressive paper doll- like Characters that helped to make the game one of five most popular ones on the site by 2012.
    <br><br>
    Around 2009, Facebook began to pull in developers, in purticular Zynga, to offer socail network games that coud be build on its fundamental
    <br>
    services; for king, this resulting in a large drop in players that they saw from their game portals within a year. At this point, king started to
    <br>
    determine how it could enter the facebook and the associated mobile game market, breaking up its web development department to work on
    <br>
    facebook and mobile games in 2010, including bringing several of their existing browser games to those platform.
    <br><br>
    In April 2011, King released its existing portal game Miner Speed as it first cross-platform (facebook and mobile) game to figure out the
    <br>
    transition between facebook and mobile games for this new direction. King's first major success in this area followed eith Bubble Witch Saga,
    <br>
    released in October 2011; by January 2012 it has attracted over 10 million players and was one of fastest rising facebook game at that time.
    <br>
    Bubble Switch Saga introduced the "saga" approach in contrast to typical tile-matching games, where intead of having game continue through
    <br>
    a fixed ammount of time or untill the player reached an unplayable state, the game was divided into discrete levels that required the player to
    <br>
    complete certain goals within a fixed set of moves, and where the next level could only be reached after completing the previous level.
    <br><br>
    King later released mobile version for IOS and Anroid that same year, adding a feature that allowed mobile users to synchronize their progress
    <br>
    with the facebook version. Knutsson started that at that time, with Candy Crush Saga as popular as it was on facebook, they knew that they
    <br>
    "had to get it right" in the transition process. King had previously discussed the nature of the games that kept their state between a PC and
    <br>
    mobile version with fabrication games, believing this was necessary trend in the future of the gaming, both recognized several of the difficulties
    <br>
    that would have to be addressed to provide both the progress synchronization and gameplay interface between mouse-driven PC computers and
    <br>
    touch-driven mobile devices.
