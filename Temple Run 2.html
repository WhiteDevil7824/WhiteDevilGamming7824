    Temple Run 2 features the same controls as its processor. However, the gameplay itself is slightly different
    <br>
    insofar as it intoduces new obstacles, such as zip-line, mine tracks, sharper turns, waterfalls and jet of fire.
    <br>
    The game also features new power-ups, whose use is typically governed by an energy bar that is filled up
    <br>
    by collecting coins, and players now can save  the protagonist from death by using green gems that are
    <br>
    collected while running, or purchased online. The game is set ina different location than the first game
    <br>
    , and then main character runs faster. The three monkeys that are chased the character in the orignal game
    <br>
    have been eleminated. Now, a single large monkey called Cuchank is the sole antagonist.

<h2 style="font-size: 30;">Development And Realese</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20;">
    The development of Tmple Run 2 begin in March 2012. Imangi Studios started that the main goal of the game was to make the gameplay similar and 
    <br>
    familiar to the orignal while introducing the new elements and creating  a "redeveloped experience". According to keith Shepherd, "our biggest reason
    <br>
    for doing the sequel intead of an update is that we just weren't going to be able to make these changes to the orignal. Under the hood, the game was
    <br>
    completely re-written from scrach and it's now in much better shape to allow us to continue adding more to it over time". Natalia Luckyanova added
    <br>
    "Once it become so popular, there was a ton we wanted to do Temple Run but it really wasn"t built for expansion. it's built on top of our in-house 3D
    <br>
    engine, which is pretty limited and requires a lot of coding in our end to make any changes. Plus, we didn't want to change Temple Run too dramatically,
    <br>
    since so many people were playing it loving it. So we decided to make a brand new version, where we could update the graphics, play around with
    <br>
    powers, create new enviroments, etc."
    <br><br>
    Temple Run 2 was announced in a surprise announcement by Imangi Studios on January 16, 2013, with the game being released in the App store in
    <br>
    New Zealand immediately, and an international release coming a few hours later. The Anroid version was released on January 24, 2013. The Windows
    <br>
    Phone 8 version was released on December 20, 2013 with the inclusion of Xbox Live achievements. A version of Tizen was released on October 13,
    <br>

    <br>
    hours. As of 2018, Imangi Studios continues to develop Temple Run 2 and other games from their Raleigh, NC location.

<h2 style="font-size: 30;">Reception</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20;">
    Temple Run 2 has been generally well-recieved. The Ios version holds an aggregate score of 79 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews.
    <br><br>
    Edge were impressed, scoring the game 8 out of 10 and writtng "Temple Run 2 is the beautifull looking, natural extension of the series that never
    <br>
    breaks stride for a second."
    <br><br>
    Carter Dobson of 148 apps scored the game 4.5 out of 5, writting "The sequel is largely just full of minor tweaks that mostly improve the experince
    <br>
    while the leaving the addictive core utampered Playing Temple Run 2 is a simple reminder of why, the orignal was such a hit, and why it stands
    <br>
    above all imitators. Its mechanics are still pristine. The formula have been tweaked, and i think it has come out for better."
    <br><br>
    AppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba gave the game 4 out of 5, the same score he had given the orignal , writting "The end result is a smoother experience
    <br>
    that retains the core of Temple Run without adding too much complexiti so as to alienate its base."
    <br><br>
    Eurogamer's owen Faraday was slightly less enthusiastic, scoring the game 7 out of 10 and writting "The biggest flow Temple Run 2 betrays is its
    <br>
    consevatism. The amount of work that has gone into the game is evident, and it's hard to fault an accessible, thrilling game that offers itself to you
    <br>
    for free-but it's so similar to it's predcessor taht it ultimately feels a bit unnecessary."
