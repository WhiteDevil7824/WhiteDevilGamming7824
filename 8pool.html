    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;billiered balls numbered 9 through 15, and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;break shot, a player assigned either the goup of solid or striped balls once they have legally
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pocketed a ball from that group. the object of the game is to legally pocket the 8-ball in a pocket,
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;which can only be done after all of the balls from player assigned group have been cleared
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;from the table.
        <br><br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The game has numreous variation, it is the second most played proffestional pool game, after
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;nine-ball.

    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HISTORY
    </h1>
    <P style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The game of eight-ball arose around 1900 in the united states as a development of pyramid
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pool, which aloows any eight of fifteen object balls to be pocketed to win. The game erose
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;from two changes made, namly thet the 8 ball must be pocketed last to win, and that each
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;player may only pocket half of the other object balls. By 1925, the game was popular enough
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;for the brunswick-balke-collender compony to introduce purpose made ball sets seven red,
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;seven yellow and one black, and the cue ball, which aloow spectators to more easily see which
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;suit each ball belonged to. Rhe rules as officially codified in the billiard congress of america's
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;rule book, were periodically revised in the years.  
    </P>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EQUIPMENT
    </h1>
    <P style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The regulation size of the table playing surface is 9 by 4.5 ft(2.7 by 1.4m), through exact
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;dimension may very slightly by manufacture. Some leagues and tournaments using the
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;World Sandardized Rules may allow smaller sizes, down to 7 by 3.5 ft(2.1 by 1.1 m). Early
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;20th century 10 by 5 ft(3.0 by 1.5 m) models are occasionally also still used. WPA
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;proffestional competition generally employs regulation tables, while the amateure league
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;championships of various league, including BCAPL, VNEA and APA, use the seven foot
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;tables in order to fit more of them into the hosting venue.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven solid-colored balls numbered 1 throough 7, seven striped balls numbered 9 through 15, an 8 ball, and a
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;cue ball.
    </P>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SETUP
    </h1>
    <P style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;To start the game, the object balls are placed in a triangular rack. The base of rack is parallel to the end rail (short end of
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;the table) and positioned so the apex ball of the rack is located on the foot spot. The balls in &the rack are idealy placed so
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;that they all are in the contact with one another, this is accomplished by pressing the ball &together towards the apex ball.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The order of the ball should be rendom, with the expectation of the 8-ball, which must be placed &in the center of the rack
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(middle of the third row), and two back corner balls, one of which must be stripe and other a solid. The cue ball is placed
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;anywere the breaker desires behind the head string.
    </P>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BREAK
    </h1>
    <P style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;One person is chosen by some predetermined method (eg, coin toss, lag, win or loss of previous game) to shoot first, using
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;the cue ball to break the object-ball rack apart. In most league it is the breaker's opponent who rackes the ball, but in some,
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;players break thier own racks. If the breaker fails to make a successfull break-usually defined as at least four ball hitting
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;cushions or an object ball being pocketed-than the opponent can opt either to play from the current position or to call for a
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;re-rack or either re-break or have the orignal breaker repeat the break.
    </P>
    <img src="9997.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="">
    <br><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If the 8 ball is pocketed on the break, then the breaker can choose either to re-spot the 8 pool and play from the currunt
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;possition or to re-rack and re-break;but if the cue ball also pocketed on the break then the opponent is the one who has
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;choice; either to re-spot the 8 ball or shoot with ball in hand behind the head string, accepting the current possition, or
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;to re-break or have braeker to re-break.
    </p>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TURN TAKING
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;A player(or team) continues to shoot until committing a foul or falling to leagally pocket oan object ball(intentionally or
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;not);thereupon it is the turn of the opposing player. Play alternates in this manner for the remiander of the game. Following
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;a foul, the incomming player has ball in hand anywhere on the table, uless the foul occured on the break shoot, as noted previously.   
    </p>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECTION OF THE TARGET GROUP
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The table is "open" at the start of the game, meaning tha either player may shoot at any ball. It remains open until one
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;player legally pockets any called ball other than the other 8 after the break. That playrer is assignedthe group, or suit,
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;of the pocketed ball-1-7(solids),9-15 (stripes)-and other suit is assigned to the opponent. Ball pocketed on the break,
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;or as the result of the foul while the table is still open, are not used to assigned the suits. Oncce the suits are assigned,
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;they remain fixed throughout the game. If any balls from a player's suit are on the table, the player must hit one of them
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;first on evry shoot; otherwise a foul is called and the turn ends. After all balls from the suit have been pocketed, the
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;player's target becomes the 8 for the remainder of the game.  
    </p>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POCKETING THE 8 BALL
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Once al of paleyr's(team's) group of object balls are pocketed, the plyer attempts to sink the 8 ball. In order to win the
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;game, the plyare first designates which pocket the 8 ball will pocketed into and then succesfully pockets the 8 ball into
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;that pocket. If the players knock the ball of the table, the player loss the game. If the player pockets the 8 ball ans commits
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;a foul or pockets it into another pocket than the one desiginated, the player losses the game. Otherwise(the 8 ball is
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;niether pocketed nor knocked off the table); the shooters turn is simply over, even if a foul occurs. In short, a word
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;standertized rules games of the eight ball, like a game of nine-ball,is not over untill the "mony ball" is no longer on
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;the table. The rule has been increasingly adopted by amateur leagues.
    </p>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WINNING
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;A player wins the game if that palyer legally pockets the 8 ball into a designated pocket after all of thier object balls
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;have been pocketed. Because of this, it is possible for a game to end with only one of the player having shot, which
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;is known as "running the table" or a "denial", conversly, it's also possible to win a game without taking a shot; such
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;as scenerio may occur if the opposing illegally pockets the 8 ball on any shot other than the break (such as sinking an
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;8 ball in an uncalled pocket, knocking the 8 ball of the table, sinking the 8 ball when a player is not yet on the black
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;ball and the cue ball off a single shot). The rules on what happens when the 8 ball is pocketed off the break vary by
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;the rules in question; please read the foul section below for more information.
    </p>
    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOULS
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The genral rules of pool apply to eight-ball, such as requirements that the cue ball not be pocketed and that the cushion
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;be hit by any of the balls after the cue ball has stuck an object ball. Fouls specific to eight-ball are:
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;● The shooter fails to strike one of their own object balls (or the 8 ball when it is the legal ball ) with the cue ball, before
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;other balls are contacted by the cue ball. This excludes "split" shots where the cue ball strikes one of the shooter's and one
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;of the oponent's abject balls simultaneously.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;● If an attempt is made to pocket a ball, and the ball hits the pocket, bounces out and lands on the ground, the ball is placed
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;in the pocket and game continues.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;● The shooter shoots the black 8 ball without designating the pocket to opposit team members or the match referee in advance. 
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;● The shooter deliberately pockets the opponent's balls whik shooting the 8 ball.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;● On the break shot, no balls are pocketed and fewer than four balls reach the cushions, in which case the incomming player
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;can be demand a re-rack and take the break and force the orignal breaker to re-break, or may take ball-in -hand behind the
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;head string and shoot the balls as they lie.

    <h1>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLACKBALL
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The british version eight-ball, known internationally as blackball, has involved into a seprate game, retaining significant
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;elements of earlier pub versions of the game, with additional influences from english billiards and snooker. It is popular
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;in amateur competition in the UK, Irland, Australia and some other countries.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The game uses unnumbered, solid, colored object balls, typically red and yellow, with one black 8 ball. They are usually
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;2 inches (51 mm) or 2+1⁄16 inches (52 mm) in a diameter, the latter being the same size as the ball used in snooker and
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;English billiard. Tables for blackball pool are 6-to7-foot (1.8 to 2.1m) long, and feature pockets with rounded cushion
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;openning, like snooker tables.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of blackball is differ from standard eight-ball in numreous ways, including the handing of fouls, which may
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;give the opponent two shoots, racking (the 8 ball, not the apex ball, goes on the spot), selection of which group of balls
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;will be shot by which player, handing of frozen balls and snookers, and many other details.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EIGHT-BALL ROTATION
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The hybrid game eight-ball rotation is a combination of eight-ball and rotation, in which the player must pocket thier
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;balls (other than 8, which remains last) in numercial order. Specifically, the solid player starts by pocketing the 1 ball
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;and ascends to the 7 ball, and the stripes player starts by pocketing the 15 ball and descends to the 9 ball.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BACKWARDS EIGHT-BALL
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;A variant in which, instead of shooting cue ball at an object ball to force the object ball into a pocket, the player
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;strikes the object ball with thier cue so it caroms off the cue ball and into a pocket, in a fashion similar to Russian
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pyramid. Also known as "reverse eight-ball".
